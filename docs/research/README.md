# Research Documents

This folder contains strategic research, analysis, and roadmap documents for the Local Brain project.

## Documents

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [001-future-roadmap.md](./001-future-roadmap.md) | Comprehensive strategic roadmap synthesized from multiple AI analyses | Active |

## Purpose

Research documents capture:
- **Strategic direction**: Where the project is heading
- **Gap analysis**: What's missing and what's needed
- **Technical proposals**: Specific implementation approaches
- **Roadmaps**: Phased plans with priorities and timelines

## Relationship to ADRs

- **ADRs** (in `../adrs/`) capture *decisions made* — they're historical records
- **Research docs** capture *analysis and proposals* — they inform future decisions

When a research proposal is accepted and implemented, the key architectural decisions should be recorded as ADRs.

## Contributing

When adding new research:
1. Use the naming convention `NNN-topic-name.md`
2. Include date, status, and clear sections
3. Link to relevant ADRs and external references
